# CertProjCovid19
Certificate Project analysing Covid19 development across world

Introduction 
Due to the current pandemic situation in which we find ourselves, a lot of data of great interest is being collected. The objective of this project is to integrate, analyze, visualize and compare data from different countries. 
Dataset 
This dataset is composed of several datasets with specific information about different countries (such as India, Brazil, US, Europe, Japan) and a dataset that includes worldwide information. The datasets can be downloaded from [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. 
The data provided by each dataset could be the same or different, due to this fact it is important to analyze the information it contains. 
Mission 
The final objective is to compare the evolution of the pandemic all over the world. To do that, some tasks need to be accomplished: 
1. Understand the content that is available in the datasets. 
2. Clean the dataset if it is necessary and integrate all the sources in one file taking into account the information that can be obtained from the datasets. Explain the decisions that you take regarding the data. 
3. Analyze the new dataset and show some statistics regarding the evolution of the pandemic. 
4. Compare the situation between different countries and all over the world. 5. According to the data, predict the future development of the pandemic. 6. Build a web data dashboard. 
7. Show some visualizations of the outcomes in the dashboard. 
Deliverables 
To carry out the assessment of the project, the group has to submit the following: 
- A report using Google Doc and explaining the concept about the project solution and the expected division of the tasks regarding the components of the group. This document should not be longer than 10 pages (including cover, table of contents, etc). - Collaborative work using Git with commit + push changes on a daily basis.
- A presentation explaining the thought process, your approaches and the reason for this choice, your findings and the real task division in your group at the end of the project. Every group has 15 minutes per presentation and there will be 5 minutes of questions.
